### Branches

### Repository Contents

#### Our Font

[On the live site](https://asdf.dev) we are using the wonderful Geomanist font from our friends at [Atipo Foundry](http://www.atipofoundry.com/fonts/geomanist). You won't it in this repo because we've only licensed it for our own use. But if you're in the market for some outstanding fonts pay them a visit.

### Build it

```
$ npm run COMMAND
```

- **dev** Runs `vuepress dev site` for development and monitors files for changes.
- **build** Runs `vuepress build site` to build the site and output files to `_build` directory.
- **release** Runs `vuepress build site` to build the site and copy output files from `_build` to `_release`.
