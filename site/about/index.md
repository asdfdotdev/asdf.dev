        Thanks for visiting my small corner of the web.
        I’m Chris, a web developer based in the beautiful Pacific Northwest. I make the web friendlier for people and computers.
        In my current role at <a href="https://www.flickerbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flickerbox</a> I work with our clients on both strategy and implementation - bringing to life tailored solutions that help move their businesses forward.

        My focus is to help organizations and companies successfully punch above their weight. 
        From neighborhood nonprofits to silicon valley startups my code helps people do more faster, transform data into information, and turn technical hindrance into strategic advantage - freeing them to focus on their core objectives.

    alt: asdf.dev is an official bronze level sponsor of the unicode low line character
  text: |
      Low Line, Underscore, &amp;#95;, U+005F, and more.
      Referred to by many names this humble, yet versatile, character is a vital member of many languages and friend to both linguist and programmer alike.
      It’s also a core brand element of asdf.dev which is why I’m proud to be an official bronze level sponsor, helping to <a href="https://www.unicode.org/consortium/adopted-characters.html#b005F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">support the Unicode Consortium</a> in their mission to standardize text in software.
