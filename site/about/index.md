        Thanks for visiting my small corner of the web.
        Iâ€™m Chris, a web developer based in the beautiful Pacific Northwest. I make the web friendlier for people and computers.
        In my current role at <a href="https://www.flickerbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flickerbox</a> I work with our clients on both strategy and implementation - bringing to life tailored solutions that help move their businesses forward.

        My focus is to help organizations and companies successfully punch above their weight. 
        From neighborhood nonprofits to silicon valley startups my code helps people do more faster, transform data into information, and turn technical hindrance into strategic advantage - freeing them to focus on their core objectives.
