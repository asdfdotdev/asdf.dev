      No marketer deserves to create their marketing links using cryptic or fragile spreadsheet formulas. Thatâ€™s why I created utm.codes, a WordPress plugin that provides a better way to create and manage campaign links.
      By leveraging popular tools for ci/cd, code coverage, coding standards compliance, and code sharing, utm.codes strives to be equally friendly for marketers and developers.
      <a href="https://utm.codes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visit utm.codes to learn more.</a>

      I love fail2ban and use it on all my servers. I wanted to keep tabs on server activity without getting notifications each time a ban takes place (or worse, having to manually check).
      fail2slack provides an easy way to receive scheduled updates with current and aggregate fails/bans for all your fail2ban jails via slack.
      <a href="https://pypi.org/project/fail2slack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get it from the Python Package Index.</a>
